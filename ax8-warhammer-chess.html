                            <p> Ok, so my girlfriend loves chess and I figured I could make her a really cool custom chess set using WFB figurines for pieces. The problem is, I haven't played warhammer in years and don't really know my way around the armies like I used to. Can anyone recommend any good choices for any of the pieces? I used to play as Lizardmen back in the day so I'm thinking Skinks for pawns, maybe Inxi-Hinxui for knights. Anyone have any better ideas? Any army, preferably not 40k though. And remember they'd.

'Tower of the Stargazer' by Lamentations of the Flame Princess is really good. amp#x200B; Can anyone recommend any others? From any system or any edition of Dungeons and Dragons? amp#x200B; 3-6 hourse play time is what I'm thinking. amp#x200B;. 
Get it HERE on Google Play (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.battletimer.dftpp) Over the past few weeks, I put together BattleTimer, which essentially is a fancy chess clock and check list app for 40k. I consume a ton of free stuff out there between battle reports, painting tutorials and you folks posting on here every day and wanted to give something back. I'm not sure what the interest will be, but at the very least here it is for you all to mull over and maybe include. Title I just got my girlfriend into DampD and she totally caught the bug. When I started talking to her about it, her parents chimed in and told me how her dad played in college- late 80’s early 90’s. I told them how I started DMing for people in college, and her dad told me that his college DM was a chess player. He got this grin on his face while he reminisced about how smart he played his monsters and villains and how the party had to work together so hard. I asked if they did long campaigns. My boyfriend is super into turn based tactics games - XCOM 2 and Shadowrun, plus absolutely every scrap of DLC and player-created content he can get his hands on. His current fixation is Jagged Alliance. I'm not as preoccupied with them as he is (I crave novelty, and if I don't have at least 4 or 5 genres of games that I'm in the middle of I start to worry) but I do love turn based tactics as well. It's hard to find these games to play together - XCOM is great and you a) want to facilitate cultural exchange with other cultures, and are b) a huge nerd for classical human board, card, and tabletop games. Which game(s) would you gift to which culture, and why? Clearly, Monopoly is a no-brainer for the Ferengi. I came across a game on Steam last night and i'm trying to find it again. Here's what I can remember: -Graphically, it was very minimalistic. It looked pretty much like a board game. Color wise it was mostly white and gray I think. -It was a strategy game where you start with 3 guys and have to kill all the enemies on the board. -All the characters were orcs or goblins or something like that. Some were warriors and some were mages. -There was a ranked system where you would Doesn’t matter To summarize: PC game Has some form of "flair" or uniqueness to it, mostly in aesthetics/purpose Good for (re)learning Bonus points if they have preconstructed scenarios/challenges. For example "Given this set up, win in X turns" or "Don't loose your Queen" or something </p>
